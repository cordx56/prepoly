# LLM agents

prepoly is new enough that an LLM has not seen it during training, so an agent
will otherwise write code in the dialect of whatever language the syntax most
resembles. The text below is a self-contained system prompt that teaches the
language from scratch. Drop it into your agent's project instructions (for
example `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`) so the agent writes valid prepoly.

# Writing prepoly

You are writing **prepoly**, a statically type-checked, structurally typed
language with Hindley-Milner type inference. It looks like a scripting language
but every function is fully type-checked just before it runs. Source files use
the `.pp` extension. Do not assume any feature from another language exists
here; rely only on what is described below. After writing code, type-check it
with `prepoly check file.pp`.

## Mental model

- Most types are inferred; annotations are optional and used to constrain.
- An integer literal defaults to `int32`; a decimal literal defaults to
  `float64`. `len()` returns `int64`.
- Records and arrays have reference semantics; mutating through one binding is
  visible through every binding that shares the object.
- There are no explicit generic type parameters. Polymorphism comes from type
  inference and from structural typing (a function constrains a value only by
  the members it actually uses).

## Lexical rules

- Comments: `// line` and `/* block, which may nest */`.
- Newlines separate statements. A line continues onto the next when it ends
  with a binary operator, or when the next line begins with `.` (method chain).
- Commas between record/type fields and between match arms are optional;
  newlines work as separators too. Trailing commas are allowed.
- String interpolation: inside a string literal, `{expr}` evaluates `expr` and
  inserts its text, e.g. `"sum = {a + b}"`. Escapes like `\n`, `\t` work.
- `if` and `match` are expressions and yield a value.

## Declarations

```
const pi = 3.14159      // immutable binding; reassigning is a compile error
let total = 0           // mutable binding
total += 10
let [a, b] = [10, 20]   // array/tuple destructuring
```

## Functions

```
fun gcd(a, b) {              // unannotated params: inferred type and mutability
    if b == 0 { return a }
    return gcd(b, a % b)
}

fun area(s: Shape) -> float64 {   // optional param and return annotations
    return 0.0
}
```

- A function with no explicit return type has its return type inferred.
- `void` is the no-value return type.
- Top-level statements run in dependency order; `main` is called last if defined.

### References and mutability

- An UNANNOTATED parameter is passed by reference and its mutability is
  inferred, so a function can mutate the caller's value through it.
- `infer` opts out of references and DEEP-COPIES the argument; the original is
  untouched. Use `infer[]` to require "an array, element type inferred".
- Explicit forms: `ref(T)` and `ref(mut(T))`.
- Closures capture their environment by mutable reference.

```
fun double(a) {            // a is effectively a mutable reference
    for e in a { e *= 2 }
}
let arr = [1, 2, 3]
double(arr)                // arr is now [2, 4, 6]

fun untouched(a: infer) {  // a is deep-copied
    for e in a { e *= 2 }
}
const xs = [1, 2, 3]
untouched(xs)              // xs is still [1, 2, 3]
```

## Types

`type` defines both records and sum types. A member written with `(params)` is
a method; one without is a field. A method whose first parameter is `self` is an
instance method (called `value.method(...)`); otherwise it is a static method
(called `Type.method(...)`). `Self` inside a body refers to the type being
defined.

```
type Account = {
    owner: string
    balance: int32

    open(owner: string) -> Account {     // static method (no self)
        return Self { owner: owner, balance: 0 }
    }
    deposit(self, amount: int32) {       // instance method
        self.balance += amount
    }
    describe(self) -> string {
        return "{self.owner}: {self.balance}"
    }
}

let acc = Account.open("Alice")
acc.deposit(100)
println(acc.describe())
```

A field without a type annotation accepts any value (its type is inferred per
construction site).

### Sum types (tagged unions)

```
type Shape =
    | Circle { radius: float64 }
    | Rectangle { width: float64, height: float64 }
    | Point                              // a variant may have no fields

let s = Shape.Circle { radius: 2.0 }     // construct as Type.Variant { ... }
```

Variants are nominal. Sum types may also carry methods in a trailing block, and
they may be recursive (a variant field can be the type itself).

### Interfaces and structural subtyping

`type B: A` makes `B` satisfy interface `A`: it requires `B` to provide every
member of `A`, checked at compile time. No implementation is inherited. Multiple
interfaces: `type B: A, C`. This works for records and for every variant of a
sum type.

```
type Showable = { to_string(self) -> string }

type User: Showable = {
    name: string
    to_string(self) -> string { return self.name }
}
```

Separately, a plain function with an UNANNOTATED parameter accepts ANY value
that structurally has the members it uses -- no interface or inheritance needed:

```
fun print_info(obj) { println(obj.to_string()) }   // anything with to_string
```

## Pattern matching

`match` over a sum type is checked for exhaustiveness. Patterns include
variants with field bindings, literals, and `_` (wildcard). `if let` matches a
single variant (or a `T.from` result) and binds its fields.

```
fun describe(s: Shape) -> string {
    return match s {
        Circle { radius } => "circle r={radius}",
        Rectangle { width, height } => "rect {width}x{height}",
        Point => "a point",
    }
}

if let Circle { radius } = s {
    println("radius {radius}")
}

match n {
    0 => "zero",
    1 => "one",
    _ => "many",
}
```

## Nullable and Result

- `T?` is a nullable type. A nullable value must be narrowed before use with an
  `if` guard: inside `if x { ... }` (or after `if !x { return ... }`) the value
  `x` is narrowed from `T?` to `T`. Inside a conditional, an inference failure
  such as reading a nonexistent field becomes `null` rather than an error.
- `T!` is a `Result`. Construct an error with `error(x)`. A bare value returned
  where a `Result` is expected is automatically wrapped as `Ok`. The postfix
  `!` operator propagates: `expr!` unwraps `Ok` or returns the `Err` early from
  the enclosing function.
- The Result variants are `Ok { value }` and `Err { error }`; match on those
  field names.

```
fun parse_positive(s: string) {
    let n = int32.parse(s)!           // returns early on parse failure
    if n < 0 { error("negative: {n}")! }
    return n                          // implicitly wrapped in Ok
}

match parse_positive("42") {
    Ok { value } => println("got {value}"),
    Err { error } => println("failed: {error}"),
}

fun first_even(nums: int32[]) -> int32? {
    for n in nums { if n % 2 == 0 { return n } }
    return null
}
let x = first_even([1, 3, 4])
if x { println("first even {x}") }    // x is int32 inside the guard
```

## Anonymous records and structural conversion

`{ field: value, ... }` is an anonymous structural record. For a record type
`T`, `T.from(v)` yields `T?`: the record value when `v` structurally has all of
`T`'s fields (decided at that call site), else `null`. Pair it with `if let`:

```
fun get_name(obj) {
    if let person = Person.from(obj) {
        return person.display()
    } else {
        error("not a Person")!
    }
}
```

## Numbers, strings, conversions

- Primitive types: `int8/16/32/64`, `uint8/16/32/64`, `float32`, `float64`,
  `bool`, `string`, `void`. There is no separate char type; a character is a
  one-character `string`.
- Conversions are explicit. `string.from(x)` always succeeds and returns
  `string`. `float64.from(int)` widens. `int32.from(x)` / `uint8.from(x)` and
  the `T.parse(s)` family can fail and return `T!`, so unwrap with `!` or
  `match`.

```
let n = int32.parse("123")!
let f = float64.from(n) + 0.5
let s = string.from(42)
let b = uint8.from(300)               // Err: out of range -> match or `!`
```

String indices are UTF-8 byte offsets (`len`, slicing, `find`, indexing agree).

## Collections and operators

- Arrays: `T[]` dynamic, `T[n]` fixed length, literal `[1, 2, 3]`, index
  `arr[i]`, append `arr.push(x)`. Tuples: `[T, U]`. Iterate with `for x in xs`.
- Operators: arithmetic `+ - * / %`; comparison `== != < <= > >=`; logical
  `&& || !`; bitwise `& | ^ ~ << >>`; compound assignment `+= -= *= /= %=`.
  Equality is `==` (a single `=` is assignment).

## Closures and higher-order functions

```
let inc = (n: int32) -> n + 1                 // expression body
let acc = (amount: int32) -> {                // block body needs `return`
    total += amount
    return total
}
let f = () -> { println("no args") }
[3, 1, 4].filter((x) -> x > 1).map((x) -> x * 10).fold(0, (a, b) -> a + b)
```

A closure passed as a parameter is called as the local value even if its name
collides with a global function.

## UFCS (uniform function call syntax)

`recv.f(args)` resolves to the free function `f(recv, args)` when `recv` has no
method `f`. This is how the standard-library array/string helpers are reached
(`arr.map(g)` calls the free `map`). Define your own the same way:

```
fun length_sq(v: Vec2) -> float64 { return v.x * v.x + v.y * v.y }
let sq = v.length_sq()                        // dispatches to length_sq(v)
```

## Modules

One file is one module; the directory layout is the module path
(`geometry/vec.pp` is the module `geometry.vec`). Import selected names with
`import path.{ A, B }`; the path is relative to the importing file. A name
beginning with `_` is private to its module and cannot be imported.

```
import geometry.vec.{ Vec2, dot }
```

## Standard library (implicit prelude, no import needed)

- IO: `print`, `println`, `input`, `read_file(path) -> string!`,
  `write_file(path, content) -> void!`. Lower-level: `open`, `File.stdin/stdout`.
- Arrays: `map`, `filter`, `fold`, `each`, `slice(start, end)`, `reverse`,
  `contains`, `sort`, `len`, `push`.
- Strings: `split`, `join`, `trim`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `find`,
  `replace`, `chars`, `to_upper`, `to_lower`, `len`.
- Math: `abs`, `min`, `max`, `sqrt`, `floor`, `ceil`, `pow`.
- `assert(cond, msg?)` aborts when `cond` is false (`msg` is optional).
- Identifiers beginning with `_` (e.g. `_string_bytes`, `_panic`) are runtime
  internals -- do not call them directly; use the prelude wrappers above.

## Concurrency (experimental -- avoid unless asked)

The only primitives are `spawn(f)` (run a closure on a thread), `with(c, f)`
(acquire a shared object to read/use it), and `sync()` (wait for spawned work
before observing its results). The compiler infers ownership automatically; you
never write move/freeze/cown. Spawned work is otherwise joined only at the end
of `main`, so insert `sync()` before a read that may race ahead.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Do NOT mix integer widths. `for i in [0..len(xs)]` style counters are `int64`;
  comparing or combining them with an `int32` is an error. Prefer iterating
  with `for x in xs`, or convert explicitly.
- Do NOT rely on implicit `int`->`float` (or any) numeric conversion; call
  `float64.from(...)` / `int32.from(...)`.
- Use `==` for equality, not `=`.
- A nullable (`T?`) value cannot be used until narrowed by an `if` guard.
- Match `Result` with the field names `Ok { value }` / `Err { error }`.
- Construct sum-type values as `Type.Variant { ... }`, and call static methods
  as `Type.method(...)`.
- Block-bodied closures and functions need an explicit `return`; expression
  bodies (`(x) -> x + 1`) do not.

## Worked example

```
type Shape =
    | Circle { radius: float64 }
    | Rectangle { width: float64, height: float64 }

fun area(s: Shape) -> float64 {
    return match s {
        Circle { radius } => 3.14159 * radius * radius,
        Rectangle { width, height } => width * height,
    }
}

fun main() {
    let shapes = [
        Shape.Circle { radius: 2.0 },
        Shape.Rectangle { width: 3.0, height: 4.0 },
    ]
    let total = shapes.map((s) -> area(s)).fold(0.0, (a, b) -> a + b)
    println("total area = {total}")
}
```
