For a usable local installation, build the complete toolchain archive. Build
only the driver binary when you are working on the compiler itself.

## Clone the repository

First, clone the Brass source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brass-cz/brass.git
cd brass
```

## Install the Rust compiler

Brass is written in Rust, so you need the Rust compiler installed first.

You can learn how to install Rust here: [https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)

## Build the complete toolchain

The recommended build creates the same layout as a release:

```bash
./scripts/pack.sh
```

The script builds `brass`, `czls`, and `czfmt`, builds the standard-library
plugins, creates the `czpm` launcher, verifies the package manager, and writes
`brass-<host-target>.tar.gz` in the repository root. The archive contains a
ready-to-move `bin/` and `std/` tree; keep those directories together after
extracting it, and add `bin/` to `PATH`.

The `x` helper used by the script bootstraps the Rust build and downloads the
LLVM toolchain required by the default native runtime.

## Build only the `brass` binary

For compiler development, build the native driver directly:

```bash
./x cargo build --release -p brass_driver
```

The binary is written to `target/release/brass`. This command does not package
the standard library, `czpm`, the language server, or the formatter. In
particular, a repository build does not automatically resolve `import std.*`;
use the complete toolchain above for normal use.

To build an interpreter-only driver without LLVM:

```bash
cargo build --release -p brass_driver --no-default-features
```

## Usage

```bash
brass program.cz         # check the needed code and run it
brass check program.cz   # check the whole program; silent on success
brass repl program.cz    # run with the interpreter
brass                    # start an interactive REPL
```

Diagnostics are printed to stderr and produce a non-zero exit status. A normal
run checks functions as it needs them; use `brass check` for a complete
whole-program result. See [Hello, world!](/guides/hello/#checking-without-running)
for the practical distinction.
