title: "Package manager"
description: "Creating projects and managing dependencies with ppm."

prepoly ships a minimal package manager called **ppm** (prepoly package
manager). It handles project scaffolding, dependency fetching, and
compilation/execution with a handful of commands.

## Creating a project

`ppm new` creates a new directory and scaffolds a project inside it:

```bash
ppm new myapp
```

This creates a new directory with the following layout:

| Path                | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `myapp/myapp/`      | Source directory for sub-modules               |
| `myapp/myapp.pp`    | Package root file (your program's entry point) |
| `myapp/package.toml`| Package manifest                               |

To initialize a project in the current directory instead, use `ppm init`:

```bash
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
ppm init myapp
```

The generated `package.toml` looks like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "myapp"
author = ""
license = "MIT"

[dependencies]
# mylib = { git = "https://github.com/user/mylib", hash = "<commit hash>" }
# mylib = { path = "../mylib" }
```

The commented lines show the two dependency forms, ready to fill in.

## Running and checking

Inside a project directory (where `package.toml` lives), use:

```bash
ppm run      # compile and run
ppm check    # type-check only
```

Both commands read `package.toml`, fetch any missing dependencies, set the
`PREPOLY_PACKAGES` environment variable, and invoke `prepoly` on the root
file (`<package-name>.pp`).

## The language server in a project

`ppm lsp` starts `prepoly-lsp` with the same dependency resolution, so editor
diagnostics, hover, and completion see the project's dependencies. Point your
editor's LSP command at `ppm lsp` instead of `prepoly-lsp` (see
[Installing the LSP server](/installation/lsp/)). In a directory without a
`package.toml` it simply starts the plain server, so the one editor
configuration works for projects and loose `.pp` files alike.

## Adding dependencies

A dependency is either a Git repository pinned to a commit hash, or a local
directory given by path. Add them to the `[dependencies]` section of
`package.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
"geometry" = { git = "https://github.com/user/geometry-pp", hash = "a1b2c3d4e5f6" }
"utils"    = { git = "https://github.com/user/utils-pp",    hash = "deadbeef1234" }
"mylib"    = { path = "../mylib" }
```

When you run `ppm run` or `ppm check`, each Git dependency is cloned to
`~/.prepoly/packages/<name>-git-<hash>` if it is not already present, and
then checked out at the pinned commit.

A `path` dependency is used in place — nothing is copied or fetched. The
path is resolved relative to the project root (the directory holding
`package.toml`) and must point at the dependency project's root directory:
the one containing its `<package-name>.pp` root file. Edits to the
dependency are picked up on the next `ppm run`/`ppm check` with no extra
step, which makes `path` the form to use while developing a library
alongside its consumer; a dependency cannot combine `path` with
`git`/`hash`.

## Importing from a dependency

Once a dependency is declared, its modules are available via `import`:

```prepoly norun
// Import specific names from the package root
import geometry.{ Vec2, dot }

// Import a sub-module
import geometry.utils.{ normalize }

// Qualified module import
import geometry
// then use: geometry.Vec2, geometry.dot(...)
```

The package root file is `<package-name>.pp` inside the dependency directory,
and sub-modules live under the `<package-name>/` directory — the same
layout that `ppm new` creates.

## Writing a library package

A library package has the same layout as an application. Declare the public
API in the root file and organize implementation details into sub-modules.
Names starting with `_` are private and cannot be imported by dependents (see
[Modules](/guides/modules/)).

```
mylib/
  mylib.pp            # public API: types, functions
  mylib/
    _internal.pp      # private helper (not importable)
    extra.pp          # public sub-module
  package.toml
```

## How it works

`ppm` sets the environment variable `PREPOLY_PACKAGES` before invoking
`prepoly`. The format is a colon-separated list of `name=path` entries:

```
PREPOLY_PACKAGES=geometry=/home/user/.prepoly/packages/geometry-git-a1b2c3d4:utils=/home/user/.prepoly/packages/utils-git-deadbeef
```

Both the compiler and the language server read this variable at startup, so
editor diagnostics and completions work for dependencies too.
