:::caution
Concurrency is **experimental**. It executes on the native (JIT) runtime
only; the REPL interpreter refuses `spawn`/`with`/`sync` at runtime.

## The primitives

The complete programmer-facing surface is three builtin functions — there is
no `async`/`await`, no explicit locks, threads, or channels, and no ownership
annotations:

| Builtin      | Type                    | Behavior                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spawn(f)`   | `(() -> void) -> void`  | run a zero-parameter closure on another thread                     |
| `sync()`     | `() -> void`            | barrier: join every task spawned so far                            |
| `with(c, f)` | `(cown, (T) -> U) -> U` | acquire the shared object `c`, run `f` with it, yield `f`'s result |

Spawned tasks are also joined at the end of `main`. Use `sync()` before
reading values a task mutates; without it the read may run ahead of the task.

## Inferred ownership

The compiler decides how each captured value crosses the spawn boundary; the
programmer never writes `move`/`freeze`/`cown`:

- a captured **primitive** (number, bool) is copied by value into the task;
- a captured **heap object** (record, array, ...) that is shared with — and
  mutated by — concurrent code is promoted to a _cown_ (concurrent owner): a
  guarded object whose accesses are serialized by its lock;
- when the spawning function itself keeps using a promoted object, every one
  of its accesses is auto-guarded by the same lock, and the compiler emits a
  warning suggesting explicit `with(cown, f)` acquisition for finer-grained
  control. The lock is reentrant, so nested guarded accesses (including
  methods that mutate `self`) do not deadlock.

`with(c, f)` acquires `c`'s lock for the duration of `f`. The group form used
internally acquires multiple cowns in address order, so a consistent lock
order is maintained.

A single-cown `with` scope is also a **region**: objects stored into the
guarded object while the scope runs belong to it, and references reaching into
the region from outside (a module global, an object that outlives the scope)
are counted. Leaving the scope while such a reference survives is a runtime
error — ``region not closed: a reference escaped a `with` scope`` — because
the escaped reference could later be used without holding the lock.
Overwriting the escaping slot (e.g. setting the field back to `null`) before
the scope ends releases the reference, and the scope closes normally.

## Static restrictions

These are compile errors today:

- `spawn`'s argument must be a **closure literal**, or a local variable
  directly bound to one — not a function reference, a call result, or a
  parameter (the ownership pass must see the closure body).
- The closure must take **zero parameters**; `with`'s closure exactly one.
- A spawned task may not read or write a **module global** that any code
  writes; share state through captured objects instead.
- `spawn` at the top level (in a module initializer, outside any function) is
  unsupported.
- Nested spawns inside an already-spawned closure are analyzed like the outer
  one; a shape the pass cannot analyze is rejected rather than left unguarded.

## Example

```brass norun
type Counter = {
    count: int32
}

fun Counter.add(self) {
    self.count += 1
}

fun main() {
    let counter = Counter { count: 0 }

    spawn(() -> {
        for i in [0..1000] {
            counter.add()
        }
    })
    spawn(() -> {
        for i in [0..1000] {
            counter.add()
        }
    })

    sync()

    with(counter, (c) -> {
        println(c.count)   // 2000: both increments serialized by the cown lock
    })
}
```
