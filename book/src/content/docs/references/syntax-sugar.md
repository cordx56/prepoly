title: "Syntax sugar"
description: "What the language constructs desugar to: the Result behind fallibility, error traces, the Default model behind methods, and sum subtyping."
---

Several Brass constructs are specified as **syntax sugar** over ordinary
prelude types. The specification is type-level: a program behaves as if the
expansion had been written out, and a type error in the expansion is
reported normally. The compiler is free to implement the constructs natively
— and does — as long as nothing observable distinguishes the implementation
from the expansion. In particular the method model below is fully **erased**:
by the time a program is lowered, method calls are direct calls and none of
the implied fields exist.

## The `Result` behind fallibility

`Result` is an ordinary two-variant sum declared in `std/prelude/error.cz`:

```brass
type Result =
    | Ok {
        value
    }
    | Err {
        error
    }
```

Every fallibility construct is sugar over it:

- A return type `T!` is `Result<T, E>` with `E` inferred from the body's
  error sources (`infer!` leaves both sides inferred).
- `error(x)` calls the ordinary prelude function of that name (see
  [error traces](#error-traces)); its result is an `Err`.
- A bare `return v` in a fallible function wraps as `Ok { value: v }`; a
  `Result`-typed value flows whole.
- `expr!` matches the operand: the `Ok` payload is the expression's value,
  an `Err` returns from the enclosing callable unchanged — or aborts with a
  rendered trace at the program's top level or in the entry `main`.

The name `Result` resolves through normal scoping at each sugar site, so a
module may **shadow** it with its own declaration:

```brass
type Result =
    | Ok {
        value
    }
    | Err {
        error: string
    }

fun parse(x: int32) -> int32! {
    if x < 0 {
        // The module's Result: construct it directly. `error(..)` is a
        // prelude function and always builds the prelude's Result.
        return Result.Err { error: "negative" }
    }
    return x * 2
}
```

A shadowing declaration must have exactly the `| Ok { value } | Err { error }`
shape (payload annotations allowed — they pin the sugar's payload types);
anything else, and an alias named `Result`, is rejected at the declaration.
The shadow and the prelude's Result are distinct types: values of one are
not usable as the other.

## Error traces

`std/prelude/error.cz` defines the error value model:

```brass
type Location = { file: string, line: int32, col: int32 }
type Frame = { message: string, location: Location }
type Error = { value, location: Location, frames: Frame[] }
```

`error(value)` wraps its payload:
`Result.Err { error: Error { value: value, location: <call site>, frames: [] } }`.
`Result.context(self, ctx)` appends a `Frame` to a failed result and leaves a
success untouched. An unhandled `!` renders the trace through
`Error.display`, newest context first:

```brass
fun a() -> infer! {
    return error("error in a")
}

fun b() -> infer! {
    return a().context("error in b")
}

b()!
```

```text
[main.cz:6:12] unhandled error: error in b
    [main.cz:2:12] unhandled error: error in a
```

Two mechanisms make this work:

- **The implicit location parameter.** A callable whose *last* parameter is
  annotated with the prelude `Location` record may be called without it; the
  compiler fills the argument with the call site's position. `error` and
  `context` declare one (`loc: Location`), which is how they know where they
  were called. The parameter is ordinary — visible in the signature, and a
  caller may pass it explicitly.
- **Error lifting at `!`.** A propagated payload that is not already an
  `Error` (a plugin's or builtin's plain string, for example) is re-raised
  wrapped into one, stamped with the propagation site. This is what lets one
  body mix `error(..)` with `!`-forwarded builtin failures. A chain that
  never touches `error(..)`/`context` and aborts directly keeps the plain
  `unhandled error: <payload>` form.

Two accepted deviations from the pure-sugar reading: `error` is reserved in
call position (a `match`'s `Err { error }` binding does not shadow the
function), and the checker types `error(..)` itself (each call's `Ok` payload
is taken from the position the call flows into) while the prelude body is
what runs.

## Methods are `Default` fields

`std/prelude/default.cz` declares the protocol type:

```brass
type Default = {
    default() -> Self
}
```

A type **satisfies** `Default` when it provides a `default()` method
producing its own default value. A method declaration is, semantically, a
field whose type satisfies `Default`:

```brass
type T = { x }
fun T.get(self) {
    return self.x
}
```

declares a member `get` on `T` whose function type's `default()` produces
the declared function, `(value) -> value.x`. In the model, `a.get` denotes
that function (a member absent from the value is materialized by its type's
`default()`), and a call `a.get()` applies it to the receiver: `(a.get)(a)`.
The model implies, and the implementation guarantees:

- A method member may be **absent from a value**: methods never affect
  structural subtyping, construction, layout, `fields(..)` iteration, or
  printing.
- A constructor cannot initialize it and code cannot assign it — the member
  is the declaration's, not the value's. (This is where the implementation
  is deliberately stricter than the model: allowing per-value overrides
  would make every method call a dynamic dispatch.)
- **Only method declarations get this treatment.** A user-declared field is
  an ordinary value field whatever its type — a field whose type satisfies
  `Default` is still required at every construction, and a structural
  subtype must provide every field.
- On a sum type, a method is present on every variant, which is also why a
  field shared by **all** variants of a sum may be read without a `match`:

```brass
type Shape =
    | Circle { r: int32, label: string }
    | Square { side: int32, label: string }

fun tag(s: Shape) -> string {
    return s.label
}
```

The built-in types satisfy `Default` with their zero values: `int32.default()`
is `0` (likewise every numeric width), `bool.default()` is `false`,
`string.default()` is `""`. An empty array is written as an annotated literal
(`let xs: T[] = []`).

An *uncalled* member access `x.m` keeps its compile-time
[member-presence meaning](./reflection#member-presence) rather than
producing the method as a value. Every receiver supports the test — the
primitive classes, records, and sums alike — and a declared method reads as
present, so `if v.m { v.m() } else { ... }` dispatches on whether the
receiver's type implements `m`, and a presence-dispatching function
instantiates at scalars too.

## Declared sum subtyping

A sum may declare another sum as its parent. It must cover **exactly** the
parent's variant set, and each variant may only *widen* the parent's variant
record (extra fields; annotated fields stay invariant):

```brass
type MyResult: Result =
    | Ok {
        value
        message
    }
    | Err {
        error
    }

fun a() -> infer! {
    return MyResult.Err { error: "message" }
}
```

At every flow site that accepts the child where the parent is required — a
`return`, a binding, an argument, a `!` operand — the value is **rebuilt** as
the parent: the extra width fields are dropped and the result is a new
value (identity and aliasing do not survive the coercion). Subtyping is
gated on the declaration; two structurally identical sums that do not
declare the relationship stay unrelated, and the relationship never
participates in unification — only in one-directional flow.

Because rebuild is the semantics, the parent's methods always run on parent
values; a child therefore does not need to (re)implement them, and only the
variant fields are checked for conformance.
