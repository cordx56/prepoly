// A child's table entry outlives its `wait`: the exit code is cached, so a
// second `wait` answers from it, and a small piped output stays readable
// because the pipe still holds what the child wrote before exiting. The
// stream accessors memoize the adopted `File`, so calling one twice is not an
// error -- the plugin gives each descriptor up exactly once.
