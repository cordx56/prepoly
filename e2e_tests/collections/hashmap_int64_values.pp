// A witness-free map whose value type is pinned to int64 by the first store.
// A later `set` with a bare integer literal (which would default to int32) is
// checked against the receiver's pinned value type via the type's scheme, so
// the literal takes int64; an int32 variable widens at the call boundary. Both
// store correctly rather than being rejected as an int32/int64 mismatch.
