// A binding annotated with a refinement alias pins the map's key/value types up
// front. The witness-free constructor's inferred slot array is seeded from the
// annotation (so it is a concrete `_Entry<string, int64>` array, not an open
// one that would read as `never`), and later stores type against the pinned
// value: an int64 variable, an int32 variable (widened), and a bare integer
// literal (which would default to int32) all store as int64.
