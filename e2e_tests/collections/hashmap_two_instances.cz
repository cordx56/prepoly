import std.collections.{ HashMap }

// Two HashMap instantiations with different value types in one program. The
// JIT memoizes per-type glue (destructor, to_string, deep copy, tracer) by a
// rendered type key; HashMap's members are all `_`-private, so the
// user-facing rendering of every instance is the bare name `HashMap`, and a
// name-only key handed one instance's glue to the other -- dropping an int32
// value as a heap pointer, which crashed at scope exit. The keys must include
// the full field substitution.

// The string-valued map is declared FIRST so its glue is emitted first: a
// shared key would then release the second map's int32 values as pointers.
fun main() {
    let a = HashMap.new()
    a.set("s", "seven")

    b.set("n", 7)

    println(b.get_or("n", 0))
    // Both maps drop at function exit: each must run its own destructor.
