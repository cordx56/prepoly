// Importing one name from a module must not leak the module's other public names
// into bare scope: only the prelude is import-free, and a library module is not
// the prelude. `index_of` lives in the url.text library module alongside the
// imported `substr` and is not imported here, so calling it is an error naming
// the module that has it.
