//! The on-disk analysis cache (`.ppcache`), shared by the `prepoly` driver and
//! the `ppls` language server.
//!
//! Type checking dominates start-up time (hundreds of milliseconds on a
//! library-heavy program; parsing and lowering are single-digit), so the cache
//! stores what the checker computed rather than anything the cheap phases
//! produce: the FINAL module ASTs -- after import canonicalization, qualified-use
//! resolution, spawn auto-acquire, and reflective (`-> infer!`) specialization,
//! so a keyed program's second full pass is skipped too -- plus the analysis
//! channels the back ends consume (`expr_types` and friends). On a hit the
//! driver re-lowers the cached ASTs (deterministic, a few milliseconds) and goes
//! straight to MIR; MIR itself is NOT cached, because lowering it takes ~2ms and
//! caching it would not remove the HIR rebuild the back ends need anyway.
//!
//! A cache is written next to its entry file (`app.pp` -> `app.ppcache`), only
//! after an analysis with NO diagnostics, and names every source file that went
//! into the build. It is reused only when every one of those files still has
//! the same contents (length and SHA-1 -- see `FileStamp`) and the compiler tag
//! matches. Sources are named RELATIVE to the root each was resolved under
//! (the entry file's directory, an include root, a package root), never by
//! machine path -- so a cache survives the whole project moving, and one packed
//! alongside a release's `bin/` and `libraries/` validates wherever they are
//! installed. The resolution environment is not part of the key either: if
//! `PREPOLY_PACKAGES` or `PREPOLY_INCLUDE` change WHERE a name resolves, the
//! resolved file's contents decide -- equal bytes are the same program, and
//! different bytes miss. Any mismatch, short read, or decode error falls back
//! to the full pipeline -- the cache can never make a build wrong, only
//! faster.
//!
//! The format is binary (postcard: varint-packed serde, no field names), chosen
//! for load speed and size; it is not meant to be read by humans, and no
//! compatibility across compiler versions is attempted -- the header pins both
//! the format and the compiler version, and anything else is discarded.
