//! Module-graph assembly for analysis.
//!
//! The graph itself comes from the shared front end
//! ([`brass_resolve::frontend`]) -- one orchestration for the driver and the
//! language server. What this module adds is the editor-specific policy: the
//! active document's text comes from the editor (unsaved), load and syntax
//! problems become diagnostics instead of aborting, and the active document's
//! AST is kept separate from its context so the incremental layer can re-check
//! a subset of its items.
