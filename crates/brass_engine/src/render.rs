//! Render-order field resolution for nominal types.
//!
//! Both back ends render a record as `T {\n    field: <value>,\n}` and a sum
//! variant as `T.Variant { ... }`, and they must show the same fields, in the
//! same order, at the same resolved types: the LLVM JIT emits its renderer as
//! IR while the REPL interpreter walks runtime values, so any drift in the
//! field decision surfaces as output-parity breakage. The functions here are
//! the one authority both back ends' renderers resolve fields through; the
//! medium-specific emission (IR construction vs Rust string building) stays in
//! each back end.

/// For a constructed value the substitution is authoritative: fields are taken
/// in declaration order with their substituted types (correct even when two
/// modules share a type name), and a declared field absent from the
/// substitution makes the whole layout unavailable. For a bare nominal
/// reference (empty substitution -- a sum variant binding or a nested declared
/// field type) the HIR declaration's field names and declared types are used,
/// so the nominal still renders. A nominal unknown to the program (a
/// structural record built at a deserialize boundary) renders its substitution
/// in its sorted field-name order.
///
/// The LLVM back end also derives a record's byte layout by walking this list,
/// so a record is constructed, accessed, and rendered through one field order.
