//! Monomorphization: collecting the concrete instances a typed back end
//! compiles, and resolving every local and return type to a concrete type.
//!
//! This is *true* single-specialization: starting from the
//! zero-parameter entry functions, each call site's concrete argument types
//! select (and, on demand, create) a callee instance, so one polymorphic MIR
//! body yields a distinct instance per concrete type tuple. Functions, instance
//! methods, and static methods (constructors) are all instantiated this way, as
//! are records (a record's field-type substitution makes each layout a distinct
//! instance), sum types (with `match`), the generic `Result` (fallible functions
//! infer its payloads), nullables, strings, fixed arrays, module globals, and
//! closures -- both called in place (params from the call site) and passed to
//! higher-order functions (params recovered by probing the callee's use of the
//! parameter). Growable arrays (`[]` + `push`, the element type inferred from the
//! push) and typed `print`/`println` are handled too. Each instance gets a
//! collision-free symbol and a fully concrete type for every local. The pass also
//! *checks* the program: a body outside the typed subset (file I/O, concurrency,
//! and other Value-based stdlib primitives) is rejected, so the back end only
//! sees validated, concretely-typed MIR.
