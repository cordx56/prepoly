//! The backend-agnostic, *typed* code-generation trait.
//!
//! [`Codegen`] is the seam between the engine and a concrete back end. Unlike a
//! boxed uniform-value ABI, every value here has a concrete type: the engine has
//! already monomorphized the program (see [`crate::mono`]) so each local, each
//! operand, and each call has a known [`brass_hir::Type`]. The trait splits in
//! two:
//!
//!  - *Leaf* methods perform one typed low-level operation -- materialize a typed
//!    constant, an `iN`/`fN` arithmetic op, a typed call, a branch -- and are the
//!    only methods a back end implements. They are where inkwell (or any target)
//!    lives; this crate names no such dependency.
//!  - *Default* methods walk the monomorphized MIR and compose the leaves,
//!    resolving the concrete type of every operand/result from the instance's
//!    `local_types` and passing it to the leaves.
//!
//! The associated [`Codegen::Value`] is the back end's typed value handle (an
//! LLVM SSA value, or a debug string in tests); the default methods only move it
//! between leaves and never inspect it.
