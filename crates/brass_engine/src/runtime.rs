//! Runtime JIT compilation: the backend-agnostic orchestration of deferred
//! monomorphization.
//!
//! When a type is fixed by the outside world at runtime (e.g. JSON deserialize),
//! the consumer must be specialized and compiled *then*. This module owns the
//! backend-agnostic half of that: a cache from an instance symbol to its compiled
//! callable address, and `resolve_or_compile`, which returns a cached address or
//! asks the back end to compile the instance once. The actual machine-code
//! generation is delegated through the [`RuntimeJit`] trait, which a target such
//! as `brass_jit_llvm` implements over a live execution engine -- so this crate
//! names no target dependency, exactly as [`crate::Codegen`] does for the static
//! path.
