//! Region metadata, the write barrier, and closedness verification. A region is the object subgraph owned by a `with` scope; its bridge
//! is the object `with` guards. Each region tracks a *local reference count* (LRC):
//! the number of references into the region from outside it, plus its bridge owner.
//! A region is **closed** when only its bridge owner references it (LRC == 1) --
//! nothing escaped.
//!
//! Regions form a tree through `parent` links: a region may be
//! nested inside another. A borrow reaching into a child region also reaches into
//! its ancestors, so the first external borrow of a child propagates a borrow up
//! the parent chain, and dropping the last child borrow propagates the release back
//! up. This lets the whole nested tree's closedness be read from a
//! single region's LRC.
//!
//! This is an additive layer over the per-object cown lock that already provides
//! data-race-freedom: regions add ownership *metadata* and a *closedness* check,
//! they do not replace the lock, so soundness is preserved. An object's region id
//! lives in the otherwise-unused `nchild` header slot (0 = not in a region).
