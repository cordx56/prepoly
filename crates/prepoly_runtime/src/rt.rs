// rc); the numeric order places the two shared classes last so the atomicity test
// is a single `>=` comparison (see `is_shared`).

//     Contained  region-interior element; mutable, not referenced from outside
//     Bridge     region entry point; a single unique external reference
//   shared (atomic rc):
//     Immutable  deeply frozen; safely readable from any thread
//     Cown       concurrent cell; reached only under its lock (with-acquire)
