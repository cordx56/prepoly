//! Cycle collector (DESIGN.md 8.3): trial deletion (the Bacon-Rajan algorithm)
//! for reference cycles that plain reference counting (`crate::alloc`) cannot
//! reclaim. A cycle keeps every member's count above zero, so no member is ever
//! freed by `pp_release`; this collector finds such garbage.
//!
//! The runtime cannot itself know an object's outgoing references (the typed back
//! end lays out records/sums), so each cycle-capable object registers a *trace*
//! function at construction (`pp_gc_register`) that visits its managed children.
//! The registry doubles as the collector's candidate set; `pp_gc_collect` runs the
//! trial deletion over it: trial-decrement child counts (mark gray), restore the
//! externally-reachable (scan/scan-black), and free what stays white (a cycle with
//! no outside references).
//!
//! Collection is scheduled generationally (DESIGN.md 8.3): registration advances an
//! allocation counter that triggers a Gen 0 collection every `GEN0_ALLOCS`
//! allocations, with Gen 1/Gen 2 milestones every 10th/100th Gen 0 (see
//! `schedule_tick`). The driver also calls `pp_gc_collect` once before exit to
//! sweep whatever remains.
