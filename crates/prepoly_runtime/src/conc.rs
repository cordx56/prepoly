//! Concurrency runtime: real-thread `spawn` and the cown acquire/release lock
//! (DESIGN.md 12). The language exposes only `spawn(f)` and `with(cown, f)`; the
//! compiler decides ownership (move/freeze/cown) and inserts acquire/release, so
//! these primitives are the dynamic half of the two-stage safety model: a cown's
//! shared mutable object is reached only while its lock is held, which makes
//! concurrent access data-race-free at runtime.
//!
//! A spawned closure's captures are made safe by the ownership analysis before
//! they reach another thread (moved when unique, frozen when read-only, or cowned
//! when mutated), so transferring the closure pointer across threads is sound.
