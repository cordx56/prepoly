//! Shared front-end orchestration: the module graph for one entry source.
//!
//! Both front ends -- the CLI driver and the language server -- assemble a
//! program the same way: the embedded prelude, then the entry source, then its
//! transitive file imports, then the nested std modules the graph names, with
//! the entry module moved to the end. [`assemble`] is that one sequence. It
//! applies NO error policy: every problem it meets is collected into
//! [`Frontend`], because policy is exactly where the callers differ -- the
//! driver aborts per problem class (syntax errors before graph errors) while
//! the language server converts everything to diagnostics and analyzes the
//! recovered graph anyway.
