//! The identity of a compiler build: the workspace version, the release
//! channel, and the git commit it was built from.
//!
//! Every binary in the tree reports its version through [`version_string`], and
//! the analysis cache keys its files on [`compiler_tag`], so that all of them
//! agree on what "this compiler" is. Nothing else should read
//! `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` directly: a per-crate version would drift from the one
//! the user sees, and a version alone cannot distinguish two builds of the same
//! release.
