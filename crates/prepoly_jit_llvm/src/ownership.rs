//! Automatic ownership analysis for `spawn` captures (DESIGN.md 12.7-12.8).
//!
//! A `spawn` runs its closure on a real OS thread, so each captured value is
//! shared between the spawner and that thread. The decision here is therefore
//! load-bearing, not advisory: [`auto_acquire`] realizes it before the spawn so
//! the capture has an atomic reference count from its first cross-thread
//! reference. A capture the closure mutates is made a cown (and its access wrapped
//! in `with`, which lock-guards it); a read-only capture is frozen (immutable).
//! Both are `rc_atomic` owner classes, which is what makes the otherwise-racy
//! cross-thread reference counting sound. [`decide`] additionally classifies a
//! capture as move/freeze/cown from its liveness for the auto-acquire diagnostic
//! (DESIGN.md 12.9.2).
