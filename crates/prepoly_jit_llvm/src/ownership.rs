//! Automatic ownership analysis for `spawn` captures.
//!
//! A `spawn` runs its closure on a real OS thread, so each captured value is
//! shared between the spawner and that thread. The decision here is therefore
//! load-bearing, not advisory: [`auto_acquire`] realizes it before the spawn so
//! the capture has an atomic reference count from its first cross-thread
//! reference. A capture that is mutated *anywhere in the function* is made a cown
//! -- its access wrapped in `with` (or the group form `_with_all` when one body
//! touches several cowns), which lock-guards it on both the task and the spawner
//! side; a capture that is genuinely read-only is frozen (deeply immutable).
//! Both are `rc_atomic` owner classes, which is what makes the otherwise-racy
//! cross-thread reference counting sound. [`decide`] classifies a capture as
//! move/freeze/cown for the auto-acquire diagnostic.
//!
//! Spawn arguments the pass can see through are a closure literal or a local
//! bound to one in the same function; any other argument (a parameter, a field,
//! a call result) is rejected with a compile error ([`SpawnError`]) -- an
//! unanalyzed spawn would share its captures with no promotion and no lock,
//! which is exactly the silent data race this pass exists to prevent.
//!
//! [`spawn_capture_summaries`] additionally computes, per function, which
//! parameters are captured by a spawn reachable inside it (iterated to fixpoint
//! over the call graph); [`auto_acquire`] uses the summaries to promote and
//! guard a caller's local that it hands to such a function, so a spawn hidden in
//! a helper still serializes the caller's own accesses.
