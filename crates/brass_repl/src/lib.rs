//! The Brass REPL execution back end.
//!
//! This crate runs a checked program without LLVM: it reuses
//! `brass_engine`'s monomorphization to produce a [`brass_engine::MonoProgram`]
//! of concretely-typed instances, then *interprets* that MIR by walking the
//! control-flow graph (see [`interp`]). It is the alternative to the typed LLVM JIT
//! (`brass_jit_llvm`): it depends only on the backend-agnostic engine, so it
//! builds and runs on any host. The interpreter covers the typed sequential subset
//! (scalars, strings, arrays, records, sums, closures, nullable/`Result`, control
//! flow, recursion); runtime features outside that subset (concurrency, file I/O,
//! deferred type dispatch) report a clear error rather than executing.
