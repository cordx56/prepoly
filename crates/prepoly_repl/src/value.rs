//! The runtime value of the REPL interpreter.
//!
//! Unlike the typed LLVM back end, which unboxes every value to a concrete
//! machine representation, the interpreter walks monomorphized MIR with a single
//! boxed `Value`. The concrete type of each operand is still known (the engine
//! resolved it during monomorphization), so the interpreter consults the operand
//! type for width/sign-sensitive integer arithmetic and for rendering -- the
//! `Value` itself only needs to distinguish the runtime shapes. Heap shapes
//! (strings, arrays, records, variants, closures) are reference-counted via `Rc`
//! so aliasing matches the language's reference semantics, and `RefCell` gives the
//! in-place field/element mutation `obj.f = v` and `arr[i] = v` perform.
