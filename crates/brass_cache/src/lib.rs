//! The on-disk analysis cache (`.czcache`), shared by the `brass` driver and
//! the `czls` language server.
//!
//! Type checking dominates start-up time (hundreds of milliseconds on a
//! library-heavy program; parsing and lowering are single-digit), so the cache
//! stores what the checker computed rather than anything the cheap phases
//! produce: the FINAL module ASTs -- after import canonicalization, qualified-use
//! resolution, spawn auto-acquire, and reflective (`-> infer!`) specialization,
//! so a keyed program's second full pass is skipped too -- plus the analysis
//! channels the back ends consume (`expr_types` and friends). On a hit the
//! driver re-lowers the cached ASTs (deterministic, a few milliseconds) and goes
//! straight to MIR; MIR itself is NOT cached, because lowering it takes ~2ms and
//! caching it would not remove the HIR rebuild the back ends need anyway.
//!
//! A cache is written next to its entry file (`app.cz` -> `app.czcache`), only
//! after an analysis with NO diagnostics, and names every source file that went
//! into the build. It is reused only when every one of those files still has
//! the same contents (length and SHA-1 -- see `FileStamp`), the compiler tag
//! matches, the entry file itself is the one recorded (the first dep -- so
//! `app` and `app.cz`, which share a cache path, cannot revive each other's
//! program), and the set of declared `BRASS_PACKAGES` names is unchanged (a
//! name newly bound captures an import's first segment BEFORE any file search,
//! so the same on-disk files no longer describe the same program). Source
//! files are named RELATIVE to the root each was resolved under (the entry
//! file's directory, an include root, a package root), never by machine path
//! -- so a cache survives the whole project moving. Native plugin libraries
//! are the exception: the synthesized wrapper embeds the library's absolute
//! path (the runtime dlopens exactly that string), so their stamps are pinned
//! `Absolute` and a cache involving plugins misses after a move instead of
//! re-lowering wrappers that would open the old location. Any mismatch, short
//! read, or decode error falls back to the full pipeline -- the cache can
//! never make a build wrong, only faster.
//!
//! Known accepted limit: a module served by an include-root file at save time
//! that a native plugin under an EARLIER root would now shadow (or the
//! reverse, a project `.cz` newly shadowing a plugin) is not re-judged by the
//! stamps; the wrapper/file distinction is only re-checked through the entry
//! and package guards above.
//!
//! The format is binary (postcard: varint-packed serde, no field names), chosen
//! for load speed and size; it is not meant to be read by humans, and no
//! compatibility across compiler versions is attempted -- the header pins both
//! the format and the compiler version, and anything else is discarded.
