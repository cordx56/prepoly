//! Streaming type checking: the checker-side API of the lazy-check pipeline.
//!
//! [`crate::analyze_streaming`] runs the same analysis as
//! [`crate::analyze_with`], but checks bodies in an execution-first order --
//! module initializers, then `main`, then the remaining functions -- lets the
//! caller reprioritize that order between bodies, and emits a [`CheckEvent`]
//! after each body with the delta of checker channels recorded since the
//! previous event. The lazy driver runs the analysis on a checker thread:
//! execution can start once the entry bodies are ready, and reaching a
//! not-yet-checked function asks (via [`Scheduler::drain_requests`]) for that
//! body to be checked next.
//!
//! Two properties of the checker shape this protocol (see the channel notes
//! on each [`ChannelDelta`] field):
//!
//! - The solver substitution is global and persistent, so a type recorded
//!   while checking one body may still contain inference variables that a
//!   LATER body pins. A delta therefore only carries fully-known values;
//!   an entry that resolves later is re-emitted by a later delta.
//! - Re-elaboration (checking a callee body again at a call site's concrete
//!   types) can revise span-keyed entries recorded earlier: overwrite them
//!   (`sum_views`, `type_names`), or remove them (`typeof_types` poisoning,
//!   the seed-conflict rule of [`aggregate_result_types`]). Deltas carry
//!   those revisions and removals explicitly, and the terminal delta -- the
//!   one flushed after the finalize re-resolution -- settles every entry.
