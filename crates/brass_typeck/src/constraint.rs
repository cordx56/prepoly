//! Deferred structural constraints on inference variables.
//!
//! A closure is type-checked once, at its definition, with its unannotated
//! parameters bound to fresh inference variables. Its body may use a parameter
//! in a way that constrains it (arithmetic, a method/field access, indexing)
//! even though the concrete argument type is only known later, at a call site.
//!
//! Each such use records a `ShapeConstraint` keyed by the parameter's inference
//! variable id. When the closure value is applied (`apply_callable`), the
//! argument is unified into the parameter and every recorded constraint is
//! verified against the now-concrete type. This makes a closure such as
//! `(x) -> x + 1` reject a `string` argument, matching the soundness a named
//! function already gets from per-call body re-checking.
