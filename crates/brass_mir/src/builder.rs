//! Incremental construction of a [`MirBody`].
//!
//! The builder keeps a "current block" cursor. Lowering pushes statements into
//! it and, when it emits control flow, calls [`BodyBuilder::terminate`] and
//! switches the cursor to a freshly created block. Once a block is terminated,
//! further statement pushes are dropped: this models the fact that source code
//! after a `return`/`break`/`continue` (or after a fully-diverging `if`) is
//! dead, exactly as the AST-walking codegen skips it.
//!
//! Locals are append-only and each is born with a fresh type *variable*
//! ([`TypeRef::Var`]); the body is type-independent until monomorphization.
