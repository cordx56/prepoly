//! The program-level MIR: every callable in a `brass_hir::Program` lowered to
//! a body, plus the closures they spawn.
//!
//! The collection mirrors how the current codegen enumerates work
//! (`codegen::gen_functions`/`gen_inits`): free functions, then record and sum
//! methods, then module init bodies, with nested closures gathered into a shared
//! table keyed by [`crate::ClosureId`]. Each item keeps the identifying metadata
//! a back end needs to mangle its symbol and route calls to it.
