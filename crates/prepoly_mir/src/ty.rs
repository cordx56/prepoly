//! The type reference a MIR local carries.
//!
//! MIR is built *before* type concretization (PLAN_MIR Stage 1): the control
//! flow graph is type-independent, so every local starts as a fresh type
//! *variable*. Monomorphization (PLAN_MIR Stage 3) walks the body for a concrete
//! call instance and replaces each variable with a `Known` concrete type, after
//! which type-driven codegen selects instructions purely from these types. The
//! `Known` variant also lets a future lowering seed types it already knows (for
//! example from a parameter annotation) without changing the IR shape.
