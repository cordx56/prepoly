//! The control-flow graph: statements, terminators, basic blocks, and the body
//! that owns them.
//!
//! A [`MirBody`] is a flat list of locals and basic blocks plus an entry block.
//! Each [`BasicBlock`] is a straight-line statement sequence ended by exactly
//! one [`Terminator`]; all branching lives in terminators, so the body is a
//! proper CFG. This is the type-independent shape the whole pipeline shares: it
//! is built once per callable (PLAN_MIR Stage 1) and later walked by codegen,
//! which reinterprets nothing structural and only maps each node to an
//! instruction by type.
