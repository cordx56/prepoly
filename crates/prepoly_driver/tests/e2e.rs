//! End-to-end tests for record-field and sum-variant features. Each `*.pp` under
//! `e2e_tests/` is run through the driver and checked against a sibling
//! expectation. Two expectation kinds are supported:
//!
//! - `*.out`: the program must run successfully and its stdout must match the file
//!   byte-for-byte (the common success case).
//! - `*.err`: the program must *fail* (non-zero exit) and its stderr must contain
//!   the file's trimmed contents as a substring. This pins the diagnostics for
//!   programs that must be rejected -- e.g. the slice-element and anonymous-struct
//!   type holes a value would otherwise corrupt the unboxed back end through.
//!
//! Cases are grouped by subsystem (`field/`, `variant/`, `types/`, `structure/`,
//! `references/`, ...). `concurrency/` cases use `spawn`/`with`, which only the JIT
//! back end runs, so that directory is skipped when the `jit` feature is off (the
//! interpreter rejects concurrency at runtime).
