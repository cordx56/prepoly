//! Spawning and controlling OS processes, as a native Brass plugin.
//!
//! `libraries/process.cz` builds the `Command`/`Stdio`/`Child` surface on
//! these primitives. A spawned child sits in a process-wide table keyed by an
//! `i64` handle; a piped standard stream leaves as a raw descriptor, which the
//! Brass side adopts as a `File` so the ordinary read/write/close methods
//! drive it.
//!
//! Stdio modes are the small integers `process.cz` translates its `Stdio`
//! variants to: 0 = inherit, 1 = pipe, 2 = null. Stream selectors are
//! 0 = stdin, 1 = stdout, 2 = stderr.
//!
//! A child's entry outlives its `wait`: the exit status is cached, so waiting
//! twice is not an error, and streams stay takeable afterwards, because a pipe
//! still holds whatever the child wrote before it exited.
