//! Process-environment queries, as a native Brass plugin.
//!
//! `libraries/env.cz` owns the user-facing API (`args`, `var`, `vars`,
//! `current_dir`) and calls in here for what needs the operating system --
//! except `args`, which is the `_argv` runtime builtin (the argument vector
//! lives in the driver process, not the environment). The plugin ABI carries
//! strings and arrays but not maps, so `env_vars` answers with a flat
//! name/value sequence the wrapper folds into a `HashMap`.
