//! Regular expression matching, as a native Brass plugin.
//!
//! `libraries/regex.cz` owns the user-facing API (the `Regex` type, `Match`,
//! `Group`) and calls in here for compilation and matching. The engine is
//! Rust's `regex`: a finite-automaton matcher with a linear-time guarantee, so
//! a pattern applied to untrusted input cannot blow up (the price is no
//! backreferences and no lookaround -- neither is expressible in an automaton).
//!
//! A compiled regex is not a value the plugin ABI can carry, so it lives in a
//! process-wide handle table and every function takes an `i64` handle -- the
//! shape the net library's TLS sessions and the hash library's streaming
//! hashers use. Unlike those, a regex is never released: a `Regex` value is
//! immutable and cheap to keep, and dropping one would need a destructor the
//! language does not have. A program that compiles regexes in a loop therefore
//! grows; compile once, outside the loop, as with any regex engine.
//!
//! Matches cross the boundary as BYTE OFFSETS into the subject string, never as
//! substrings: Brass string offsets are UTF-8 byte offsets throughout, so the
//! wrapper slices the text itself and the offsets stay meaningful to a caller
//! that wants them (`Match.start`/`end`). Offsets from this engine always fall
//! on character boundaries.
