// Message digests: MD5, SHA-1, and the SHA-2 family, one-shot or streaming,
// plus HMAC over any of them.
//
// A digest is a `uint8[]` -- the algorithm's raw output -- rendered as text
// with `hex`. Text is hashed by its UTF-8 bytes, so a string is hashed as
// `sha256(to_bytes(s))`; `to_bytes`/`to_text` are prelude functions, so no
// further import is needed.
//
// This is a library rather than part of `std`: the digests are RustCrypto
// implementations behind a plugin. Every one of these algorithms is built from
// wrapping 32/64-bit arithmetic, which prepoly does not have, so a prepoly
// implementation would be a hand-masked emulation whose failure mode is a
// silently wrong digest. Point `PREPOLY_INCLUDE` at this directory and import
// it:
//
//     PREPOLY_INCLUDE=/path/to/libraries
//     import hash.{ sha256, hex }
//
// Build the plugin once with `libraries/build.sh`.
//
// SECURITY: `md5` and `sha1` are BROKEN against collision attacks. They are
// here to interoperate with things that already speak them (a published MD5
// checksum, a git object id), never to decide whether two inputs are "the
// same" in a security sense -- use `sha256` or `sha512`. All of these are FAST
// hashes: storing a password needs a purpose-built slow KDF (argon2, scrypt,
// bcrypt), which this library deliberately does not offer, so that a fast hash
// cannot be mistaken for one. Compare digests and MACs with `equal`, not `==`.
